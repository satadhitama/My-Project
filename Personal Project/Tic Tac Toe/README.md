## About this project

This might a simple project, but need some effort on logic behind the game.

The challenging part is making the logic on how player will win the game if they already 3 cells straight. So I come up with the idea that for every cell click, the app will check the cell's adjacent to 3 cells outside the clicked cell. This will give the cell any win possibilities that occurred when clicking the current cell.
